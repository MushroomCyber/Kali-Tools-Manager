# Publishing the Project to GitHub

Follow these steps from your Kali terminal after cleaning the working tree (all autogenerated caches removed and `.gitignore` added).

## 1. Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Sign in at https://github.com/new.
2. Choose a repository name (for example `kalitools`).
3. Keep it private or public depending on your needs.
4. Leave "Initialize with README" unchecked (we already have one).
5. Click **Create repository**. Copy the Git URL shown (HTTPS or SSH).

## 2. Initialize Git Locally (if not already done)
```bash
cd ~/kalitools
git init
```

> Skip `git init` if this folder already has a `.git` directory.

## 3. Configure User Identity (once per machine)
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

## 4. Review Status and Stage Files
```bash
git status
```
Ensure `__pycache__` or other build artifacts do **not** appear (the provided `.gitignore` filters them). Then stage everything:

```bash
git add .
```

## 5. Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial import of Kali Tools Manager"
```

## 6. Add the Remote and Push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/kalitools.git
git branch -M main
```

Push the commit:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 7. Verify on GitHub
Refresh the repository page—files, docs, and history should match your local tree. Use the GitHub web UI to create issues, pull requests, or enable workflows as needed.

## 8. Ongoing Workflow
- Make changes locally.
- Run tests (`python -m unittest discover tests`).
- Commit with meaningful messages.
- `git push` to share updates.

Refer back to this document whenever you need to re-create the remote or onboard collaborators.
